# Matlab-Read-Image-Corner-Detection
This project was developed during my Computer Vision course. We were given an image, and our task was to write a Matlab script that detects the corners in the image using instructions provided with some of our own additions to the code. Lastly, we had to display the image to the user with all the corners highlighted with a green icon.
